| Concept        | Description                                                                 | Example Class              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Encapsulation  | Restrict direct access to data using access modifiers.                      | `User`                     |
| Inheritance    | Derive new classes from a base class to reuse functionality.                | `EmailNotification`        |
